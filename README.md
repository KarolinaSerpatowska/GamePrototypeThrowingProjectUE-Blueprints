# ThrowingProject Blueprints

Game prototype which I made to learn the Unreal Engine. Everything is made with blueprints.

Developed with Unreal Engine 5.0.

Some animations are missing and replaced with placeholders (final version uses some paid assets).

All of my code and assets can NOT be used commercially without permission.



Gungnir 3d model by me (Karolina Serpatowska).

Used assets:

Animations: Mixamo
